PRODUCT REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT (PRD)
Smart Classroom & Timetable Scheduler

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Smart Classroom & Timetable Scheduler is a production-ready web-based platform designed to automate the complex process of timetable generation for large-scale higher education institutions. Built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the system addresses challenges in scheduling by optimizing resource allocation, preventing clashes, and supporting multidisciplinary learning as per NEP 2020 guidelines.
Target Scale:

20+ Departments
100+ Branches
500+ Sections

Labs requiring extended durations


2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Higher education institutions face significant challenges in timetable preparation:

Manual Scheduling Issues: Time-consuming process prone to human errors
Resource Constraints: Limited classrooms, labs, and faculty availability
Clash Management: Faculty, room, and section conflicts
Uneven Distribution: Imbalanced faculty workload and classroom utilization
NEP 2020 Complexity: Multidisciplinary courses and electives increase scheduling complexity
Scalability: Managing 500+ sections across 100+ branches manually is impractical
Transparency: Lack of visibility into workload distribution and resource utilization


3. OBJECTIVES

Automate Timetable Generation: Reduce manual effort by 90%+ through intelligent scheduling algorithms
Eliminate Clashes: Ensure zero faculty, room, and section conflicts
Optimize Resource Utilization: Maximize classroom and lab usage efficiency

8. SYSTEM WORKFLOW
8.1 Initial Setup Workflow

Admin logs into the system
Admin configures system parameters (working days, slots, durations)
Admin adds departments
Admin adds branches under departments
Admin adds rooms and labs
Admin adds faculty with department affiliations
Admin creates subjects with weekly hours
Admin creates sections and assigns subjects

8.2 Timetable Generation Workflow

Admin selects department/branch/semester for timetable generation
System validates all required data is present (faculty, subjects, rooms, sections)
Admin clicks "Generate Timetable"
System runs scheduling algorithm:

Allocates subjects to time slots
Assigns faculty to subjects
Assigns rooms to sessions
Checks constraints and clashes


System displays generated timetable with clash report
If clashes exist:

Admin reviews clash details
Admin either:

Manually resolves clashes, OR
Regenerates with different parameters




Once clash-free, Admin reviews workload distribution
Admin approves and publishes timetable
System notifies all affected users (Faculty, HOD, Students)

8.3 User Access Workflow
Faculty:

Faculty logs in
Views personal timetable dashboard
Checks weekly schedule, rooms, sections
Exports personal timetable if needed

HOD:

HOD logs in
Selects department
Views department-wise timetables
Checks faculty workload reports
Exports department schedules

Student:

Student logs in
Selects semester and section
Views section timetable
Notes room assignments and timings
Exports timetable for offline reference

## **11. TIMETABLE GENERATION LOGIC**

### **11.1 Algorithm Overview**

The system uses a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) approach** with **Backtracking** and **Heuristic Optimizations**. This is practical and implementable within 3 weeks.

**Algorithm Type:** Backtracking with Forward Checking and Heuristics

**Time Complexity:** O(b^d) where b is branching factor, d is depth
- With heuristics and pruning, practical for 100+ sections

---

### **11.2 Step-by-Step Timetable Generation Logic**

#### **Step 1: Data Collection and Validation**
```
Input:
- Selected department/branch/semester
- Sections to schedule
- Subjects per section with weekly hours
- Available faculty
- Available rooms
- System configuration (days, slots, durations)

Validation:
1. Check all sections have assigned subjects
2. Check all subjects have eligible faculty
3. Check sufficient rooms are available
4. Check faculty total load doesn't exceed system capacity
5. Verify weekly hours are achievable within available slots
Step 2: Initialize Data Structures
javascript// Weekly timetable grid
timetableGrid = {
  section_id: {
    'Monday': [slot1, slot2, slot3, ...],
    'Tuesday': [...],
    ...
  }
}

// Faculty schedule tracker
facultySchedule = {
  faculty_id: {
    'Monday': [slot1, slot2, ...],
    totalWeeklyHours: 0
  }
}

// Room availability tracker
roomAvailability = {
  room_id: {
    'Monday': [available_slots],
    ...
  }
}

// Subject hours remaining
subjectHoursRemaining = {
  subject_id: weeklyHoursRequired
}
Step 3: Prioritize Subjects (Heuristic)
Priority Order:

Lab subjects (need consecutive slots)
Subjects with fewer eligible faculty (constrained)
Subjects with higher weekly hours
Theory subjects

javascriptsubjects.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a.isLab && !b.isLab) return -1;
  if (a.eligibleFaculty.length < b.eligibleFaculty.length) return -1;
  if (a.weeklyHours > b.weeklyHours) return -1;
  return 0;
});
```

#### **Step 4: Slot Allocation Loop**
```
For each section:
  For each subject in priority order:
    hoursToSchedule = subject.weeklyHours
    
    While hoursToSchedule > 0:
      
      // Step 4a: Find available slot
      For each day in workingDays:
        For each slot in availableSlots:
          
          // Skip break/lunch slots
          if (slot is break/lunch) continue;
          
          // Check if slot is available for section
          if (section has class at this slot) continue;
          
          // For labs, check if next slot is also available
          if (subject.isLab):
            if (next slot not available) continue;
          
          // Step 4b: Find available faculty
          availableFaculty = []
          For each faculty in subject.eligibleFaculty:
            if (faculty is free at this slot):
              if (faculty.weeklyHours < faculty.maxWeeklyHours):
                availableFaculty.push(faculty)
          
          if (availableFaculty is empty):
            continue; // No faculty available
          
          // Select faculty with minimum current workload (load balancing)
          selectedFaculty = facultyWithMinWorkload(availableFaculty)
          
          // Step 4c: Find available room
          availableRooms = []
          For each room in rooms:
            if (room.capacity >= section.studentStrength):
              if (subject.isLab and room.type == 'lab') OR
                 (subject.isTheory and room.type == 'classroom'):
                if (room is free at this slot):
                  availableRooms.push(room)
          
          if (availableRooms is empty):
            continue; // No room available
          
          // Select room (prefer department-specific rooms)
          selectedRoom = selectOptimalRoom(availableRooms, section.department)
          
          // Step 4d: Assign to timetable
          if (subject.isLab):
            // Assign 2 consecutive slots
            assignSlot(section, day, slot, subject, faculty, room)
            assignSlot(section, day, slot+1, subject, faculty, room)
            markFacultyBusy(faculty, day, slot, slot+1)
            markRoomBusy(room, day, slot, slot+1)
            hoursToSchedule -= subject.sessionDuration
          else:
            // Assign single slot
            assignSlot(section, day, slot, subject, faculty, room)
            markFacultyBusy(faculty, day, slot)
            markRoomBusy(room, day, slot)
            hoursToSchedule -= subject.sessionDuration
          
          break; // Move to next hour requirement
      
      // If no slot found after trying all days/slots
      if (hoursToSchedule not reduced):
        // Backtrack or report infeasibility
        return GENERATE_ALTERNATIVE or REPORT_CONSTRAINT_FAILURE
Step 5: Clash Detection
After generation, run comprehensive clash detection:
javascriptclashes = []

// Faculty clash detection
For each faculty:
  For each day:
    For each slot:
      assignments = getAssignmentsForFacultyAtSlot(faculty, day, slot)
      if (assignments.length > 1):
        clashes.push({
          type: 'faculty',
          faculty: faculty,
          day: day,
          slot: slot,
          conflictingAssignments: assignments
        })

// Room clash detection
For each room:
  For each day:
    For each slot:
      assignments = getAssignmentsForRoomAtSlot(room, day, slot)
      if (assignments.length > 1):
        clashes.push({
          type: 'room',
          room: room,
          day: day,
          slot: slot,
          conflictingAssignments: assignments
        })

// Section clash detection
For each section:
  For each day:
    For each slot:
      assignments = getAssignmentsForSectionAtSlot(section, day, slot)
      if (assignments.length > 1):
        clashes.push({
          type: 'section',
          section: section,
          day: day,
          slot: slot,
          conflictingAssignments: assignments
        })

// Check faculty workload limits
For each faculty:
  totalHours = calculateTotalWeeklyHours(faculty)
  if (totalHours > faculty.maxWeeklyHours):
    clashes.push({
      type: 'workload',
      faculty: faculty,
      totalHours: totalHours,
      maxAllowed: faculty.maxWeeklyHours
    })

return clashes
Step 6: Generate Alternative Timetables
If user requests alternatives:
javascriptalternatives = []

For iteration = 1 to maxAlternatives (e.g., 3):
  // Change heuristics slightly
  - Randomize faculty selection among equally loaded faculty
  - Try different slot starting points
  - Shuffle subject priority within same category
  
  generatedTimetable = generateTimetable()
  
  if (generatedTimetable has fewer clashes than previous):
    alternatives.push(generatedTimetable)
  
return alternatives
```

---

### **11.3 Optimization Techniques**

1. **Heuristic Ordering:** Schedule constrained subjects first
2. **Load Balancing:** Distribute faculty workload evenly
3. **Greedy Room Assignment:** Prefer department-specific rooms
4. **Early Clash Detection:** Check constraints before assignment
5. **Caching:** Store faculty and room availability in memory
6. **Indexing:** Use MongoDB indexes for fast lookups

---

### **11.4 Edge Cases Handling**

1. **Insufficient Faculty:** Alert admin to assign more faculty
2. **Insufficient Rooms:** Suggest sharing rooms across departments
3. **Unsatisfiable Constraints:** Provide detailed report of conflicts
4. **Lab Scheduling at Day End:** Don't schedule labs in last slot if they need 2 slots
5. **Faculty Preference:** Honor preferred slots when possible (soft constraint)
